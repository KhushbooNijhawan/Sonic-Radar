 ### Components:
 -> Arduino uno
 
 -> HC-SRo4 Ultrasonic Sensor
 
 -> Breadboard
 
 -> TowerPro SGgo Servo Motor
 
 -> Jumper cables
 
---------------------------------- 
 ### Software:
 -> Arduino Ide
 
 -> Processing application
 
-------------------------- 
 ### Working:
The Ultrasonic Sensor collects the object information with the help of Arduino wherein the servo sweeps from 00 to 1800 and back again to 00 and passes it to Processing Application. In the processing application, there is a simple Graphics application implemented which mimic a radar screen.
